## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues (v2.0 Troubleshooting)

1. **"Creator not found"**: 
   - Ensure creator is registered via Admin Panel on the selected chain
   - Check that creator wallet address matches exactly (case-sensitive)
   - Verify you're connected to the correct network

2. **"Not a registered creator"** (Viewer Rewards):
   - Only registered creators can send viewer rewards
   - Register as creator first via Admin Panel
   - Confirm creator status is "Active"

3. **"Viewer rewards disabled"**:
   - Platform admin has temporarily disabled viewer rewards feature
   - Check platform stats in Admin Panel for current status

4. **"Transaction failed"**:
   - Insufficient balance for gas fees + relay costs
   - Network congestion - try increasing gas price
   - Check minimum relay amounts via Relay.link API

5. **"Relay service unavailable"**:
   - Relay.link service may be down or maintaining
   - Check supported routes: source chain ‚Üí ApeChain
   - Verify USDC liquidity on destination ApeChain

6. **"Invalid tier calculation"**:
   - Ensure creator tier is properly set (0-3 for Tiers 1-4)
   - Check fee breakdown in UI matches expected tier percentages
   - Verify contracts have latest tier configuration
